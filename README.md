# Todo App : Express React and Node

This is a simple app that get's the basics down for React and Express. In this app all of the todo tasks are stored in the Express backend while the React front end allows users to add, delete, and edit items.

# React Frontend
The React Frontend is running on `http://localhost:3000/` and provides a simple UI.

# Express Backend
The Express server is running on port `4200` and does not perform any server side rendering.
